This is an introductory paragraph in the _Tautology License For
Licensing Content_. The _Tautology License For Licensing Content_

### Terms and Conditions

0. You may alter, edit, or otherwise modify a given _work_,
henceforth defined as any work to which this license applies, 
if you change the contents of that _work_. This will be known as

original author of a given _work_, provided that you acknowledge
the original author of a given _work_.

2. You may freely share, reuse, and duplicate both original 
_works_ and their associated _derivative works_ at no cost, on the
condition that you are not charging for them.

3. You may freely share, reuse, and duplicate both original
_works_ and their associated _derivative works_ commercially, with
the stipulation that they must have a non-zero cost.

4. Should you choose to abandon the _TFLFC_ as a suitable
license for your content, the provisions heretofore outlined will
no longer apply to your _work_ or _derivative work_.

In no event shall the author of this license be liable for any
claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of
